# Broken

Broken was intended to be a tetris variant, somewhat similiar to puzzle fighter (for those who have played it), however due to time constraint and understanding gap, the game could not meet the requirements.

Therefore Broken has evolved into a survival horror game, where the aim is to stay in the game for as long as possible without touching the top.
